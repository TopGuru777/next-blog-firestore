## Getting started

**Step 1** Create [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com)

**Step 2** Setup Authentication 
 
  * Click "Set up sign-in method" on Authentication section.
  * Enable just Google authentication provider.
  * Add your domain (if you have one) to "Authorized domains".
 
**Step 3** Create Firestore database

Go to "Database" section and create Firestore instance. Firestore is still in beta, but we don't care.
 
**Step 4** Database configuration.
 
* Go to "Rules" section in your database and paste configuration from `.firebase-rules` in project root.
* Publish new rules.
 
**Step 5** Set up Firebase secret keys for our app.

* Create `.env` at the root of the project. Do not commit this file. It is personal data that should not be available for everyone.
* Go to "Project settings" in Firebase console (click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview"). 
* Copy data from this page to `.env` in the following format:
 
 ```bash
 F_PROJECT_ID=<your Project ID>
 F_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your Project ID>.firebaseapp.com
 F_API_KEY=<your Web API Key>
 ```

**Step 6** Set up Firebase Admin SDK key for importing/exporting data from database

In order to be able to initialize database with initial seed we need to generate
private Firebase Admin service key.

Go to "Project Settings" => "Service Accounts" and click "Generate new private key" button.
Save downloaded file as `firebase-service-key.json` at project root. Do not commit this file. It's added to `.gitignore` by default.

**Step 7** Initialize database with initial data

We almost finished. Let's initialize our database with initial data.

```bash
yarn run seed
```

**Step 8** Setup database indexes.

**Step 9** Run blog locally

**Step 10** Sign in to admin part

**Step 11** Ready to go! Create new post or edit existing and publish changes.

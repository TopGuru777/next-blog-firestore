I know not everyone in my hometown understands why I moved to Poland. The things are getting even worse when it comes to my new profession. Why would a graduate of Philological faculty become a technical writer? The reason for this confusion is a lack of information + stereotypes that people might have. \n\n```marksy\n<Blockquote>\nIf you are humanist, you probably do not consider IT companies as a future place of work.</Blockquote>\n```\n\nIf you are a humanist, you probably do not consider IT companies as a future place of work. I did not consider as well until the moment I moved to an only-IT-companies city. I went to the interview just to see the office of a well-known company, not to get the job - that is how little I consider my chances are. But later I found out that among 10 the writers in my team 7 are linguists/philologist/ex-teachers of English as the main requirement is English proficiency, not deep technical knowledge.\n \nWhat do the tech writers do? The main goal is to gather the information from the technicians, translate it into a human language and write it according to a style guide. Here some complications appear: how can I write about something I don't understand? - the humanist might ask. The answer is that every person can understand everything if tries hard, at least to certain extent… Writers do not need to develop a product, but just understand how it works. \n \nSome other things I can do during the day: review the other documents, send emails asking to send info/review/approvals documents, test the documents, restructure existing content, create presentations about my team/our improvements, attend a different kind of meetings. \n \nI enjoy creating presentations, I like to structure all the mess I get from the developers and make the text easy to understand. I also like to review the other texts. \n\n***\n \nIf the profession becomes more well-known I am sure that many humanists will choose it. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the job?\n \nTo work in IT is an advantage itself. Here are some things I enjoy most of all:\n \n* One of the best things is communication between the team members and the managers. I have one-on-one meeting with my manager every month where I can discuss my worries, problems, ideas, career goals. It is like a free psychiatrist session but with good consequences for your career. Also, managers never control the time you spend at work and do not really care how you spend your day as long as your tasks are done.\n\n* Tech writer is a job with minimum stress. Deadlines are blurring, no one pushes you and almost never make you work after 6 or on the weekends. If you've made a mistake, managers will gently explain to you how to fix it. \n\n* Every day you learn something new and there's a great field to learn even more if you are ready. If one year ago someone would tell me I will be programming, I would laugh in their face. As today I do not think it is as hard as I imaged, it seems logical career development for me.\n\n* The work brings satisfaction, especially if you work hard. You see the results, you always get feedback, someone cares about your career which in the end of the day makes you feel happy.\n\n* People in IT are very normal. It's also one of the drawbacks but the good side is that they are calm, nice and friendly.\n\n* You can work remotely which gives an opportunity to travel.\n\n* For girls, it's fun to be surrounded by the boys. For me, it means no judgment of my clothes and make up extra 8 hours a day.\n\n* There is no struggle with: does anyone need it? Do I do something worth doing? I mean, there can be but less than in many other jobs. It is really important for me to know that people need my writing. For the sake of creative struggle, I have this blog :D\n\n* And the last but not least is the salary. Among all the writers (except the one who wrote best sellers) tech writers get the best salary and perks. This point is for all the people who told me many times that philologists cannot make money (and can only work in McDonald's).\n \nI did not find many disadvantages but I am not the person who usually notices a lot of them. Some obvious:\n\n* Lack of communication. For me, it is a great drawback as communication is one of my strongest skill that I want to develop. I am the only tech writer in the office and I know it is a common case for many companies. All the other tech writers in my team work in India and sometimes I feel lonely and isolated. \nAlso, this job will not suit the person who cannot work by her or himself for many hours. If one day I decide to switch career, lack of communication will be the first reason.\n\n* The product can be so complicated that no one would be able to explain you the whole thing. I am constantly working on increasing my knowledge but feel like I will never be able to understand it one hundred percent. \n    \nTo sum up, the positive sides overcome negative ones. Half of the year had passed since I've started and this story is to be continued...\n",
